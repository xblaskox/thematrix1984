# thematrix1984
This is for my Text Based Game, The Matrix 1984, based on the BASIC coded games from the 80s by John E. Dell, but coded in Python in 2025.
The objective of the game is to survive the Matrix as it was in 1984 by navigating the WaReZ scene, buying warez and selling (downloading and uploading).
You want to travel to nodes (locations) to buy low and then sell high to obtain credits. You use those credits to purchase weapons, armor and health packs.
As you navigate the Matrix, you will come across civilians who will be given a choice. In the form of a mini game, you'll give them that choice.
If you are successful, they will take the red pill and you will have "freed their mind" and if you fail, they will take the blue pill, choosing to stay in the Matrix.
The consequence of failure is that they will immediately be taken over by an Agent and a battle will ensue.
Agents will track your movements any time you do anything that changes the matrix. Buying, selling, moving- its all in the code. Agents can and will ambush you at any time.
The Matrix doesn't have "days" but it does have "cycles". You want to survive for 30 cycles, freeing as many minds as you find, battling Agents and keeping on the run.
There are secret Perks to unlock, New Game + options after you survive the game successfully, save game feature, continuing and secret encounters from familiar faces.
This project was to utilize the tools that I learned from Boot.Dev. I wanted to learn to code in Python and I thought this would be a fun project.
It's an amazing feeling to create a game like this. I remember playing John Dells games way back when and it was always a good time. This is a project and a tribute to simpler times.
